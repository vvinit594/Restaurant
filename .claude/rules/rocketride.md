# RocketRide: AI Pipeline & App Platform

Use RocketRide when building AI pipelines (document processing, RAG, agents, data integration) or when building apps on the RocketRide platform (React UIs on the platform shell, often embedding pipelines).

## Documentation

Full docs: `.rocketride/docs/`

**Read the relevant doc(s) before generating any RocketRide code.**

## Before writing ANY RocketRide code

1. Read `.rocketride/docs/ROCKETRIDE_README.md` and follow its task router for the job at hand
2. Building a pipeline: ROCKETRIDE_CONCEPTS.md + ROCKETRIDE_PIPELINES.md + ROCKETRIDE_COMPONENT_REFERENCE.md
3. Building an app: ROCKETRIDE_CONCEPTS.md + ROCKETRIDE_APPS.md + ROCKETRIDE_UI_COMPONENTS.md
4. Driving either from code: NEVER invent anything — verify `client.*` method names and signatures against your language's API doc (`ROCKETRIDE_python_API.md` / `ROCKETRIDE_typescript_API.md`), and pipeline component names and config fields against `.rocketride/services-catalog.json` and `.rocketride/schema/`
5. Two connections may exist in `.env`: `ROCKETRIDE_URI`/`ROCKETRIDE_APIKEY` (development - run/validate/iterate) and `ROCKETRIDE_DEPLOY_URI`/`ROCKETRIDE_DEPLOY_APIKEY` (deployment target - deploy/publish/schedule). Never run lifecycle verbs against the dev pair; if the DEPLOY pair is absent, no deploy target is configured - ask the user.
6. NEW apps are created ONLY through the scaffold - agents call `client.deploy.createApp(slug, ...)` (install the client first from the workspace's own `.rocketride/client/rocketride.tgz` - the scaffold vendors it from the connected server, so it is present once the workspace has been opened against one; with no server URL known the scaffold skips vendoring and the tarball lands on the next connected open - NEVER from the npm registry); humans use the App Builder's New App wizard. Never hand-create app files. (For lifecycle operations generally, prefer the `rocketride` command; see ROCKETRIDE_CLI.md.)
